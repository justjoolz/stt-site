***What markets do you trade?***

**In the capacity of trader consultant and mentor, I have helped traders trade forex, commodities, equities and stocks with the exact same training. **I am a forex specialist, but I rely on charts. In terms of difficulty, I believe the forex market to be the choppiest, most deadly market. Commodities comes after in my book, followed by equities and stocks. I have trained clients who later decide the forex market is too much trouble to trade. No problem – they go on to do very well in commodities and even futures trading. The principles of price motion are universal, and they apply the same methods to every market systematically. Some markets just cooperate better than others.

***How long will it take before I see results?***

With applied diligence, many traders should begin to see some fruits of their work within six months of completing the training program. Clearly, previous experience, personality and commitment will be factors, but that is a reasonable period. **The important thing is to aim for consistency.** It is far better to master a method that can be reliably repeated forever than to make a bundle in a month (I regularly have new traders outdo me in the short term) and then lose it all next month. In trading, the game is ***sustainable***** and *consistent *profitability.**
