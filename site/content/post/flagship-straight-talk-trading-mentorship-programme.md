Dear Friend,

***WHAT THE STRAIGHT TALK MENTORSHIP PROGRAMME IS NOT***

The best way to tell you about the Straight Talk Trading Mentorship is to begin by telling you what it is not:

* **It is not a get-rich-quick program. **There is no promise money will fall from the sky. (In fact, I guarantee that it won’t.)\
  .

* **It is NOT a fixed syllabus repeated by rote for everyone**, although the core methods and principles are broadly similar. Do you hand a drowning person a glass of water? Do you hand a child a knife to play with? **The whole point of mentorship is so that each person gets one-on-one coaching *specific *to what they need.** Providing you with the wrong information is as good as drowning you. *I’m more interested in giving you what you need (which is usually not what traders want).* If I thought a cookie-cutter training was enough to springboard from losing trader to winning trader, I’d run mass seminars and cram them full of people instead. (From a business point of view, they make MUCH more money.)\
  .\
  You want MORE information? There’s plenty of it on the internet – you don’t need me for that. I’m in the business of training traders, not encyclopedias. ***Just let me tell you what works and doesn’t so we can get on with making you profitable.*** If you really want to discuss more systems that are usually a repeat of another system that is a repeat of another system, we can talk about it later, once you’ve found your feet.\
  .

* **It is NOT an automatic download of everything I know into your head. **The worst request you can make of me is, “Teach me everything you know.” Do you have years of free time to chase every squirrel up trees in the hope you will get it right? *I point you directly to what you need, and then you verify it in the markets.* Then we can spend as much time as possible refining your ability to actually trade in real time.\
  .\
  Incidentally, ***the process of facilitating a skill like trading is much trickier than you may think – you have to circumnavigate an individual’s perceptions, beliefs and emotions.*** You are paying me to help you wire the Winning Trader’s Mindset into yourself at a deep level. It is not enough to intellectually know what you are “supposed to do”. You have to be able to live it and trade it by instinct. This is a process of show-verify-adjust repeated multiple times, and I have to nudge you into making certain discoveries for yourself, or you simply will not get it. I have to keep adjusting what you see in order to reveal the inner workings of the market. In short, **this is for those who are interested in getting their trading successful in the fastest way possible.**

I  used to get real detailed around here about what’s in the course, but in the end clients who asked me to “tell them more” would just get more lost. In any case, I already told you that the exact details depends on what you need, so I’ll explain the programme in a more meaningful way – in **absolute bottom line terms** rather than jargon – so that you will see if this is a good fit for you.

***THE MENTORSHIP CONTENT – IN BOTTOM-LINE TERMS***

The “content” of the course WILL make you:

1. **Understand why you failed before.** Unless you are a completely new trader, you have probably tried your hand live in the market and lost money. We will explore in the application interview why this happened. You see, very often, ***learning traders do not know what they do not know.***** **That makes it difficult for them to even figure out if something is worth learning, because they’re groping in the dark. And that is exactly how they get into trouble. **In trading, you can have 95% of the picture, and maybe even have that 95% perfectly right, and you will still lose money.\
   **.**\
   **Likely as not, you have already knocked right on the door of profitability, as many have before you. But it is a door with many locks, and because other traders are missing just one key, they just can’t get it to open. It is the *combination *of all the keys that will make trading profitable. *Not understanding that, they will probably throw everything away and start again, wandering lost forever.* So the question is: **Can you afford to spend time lost in the woods?\
   **.**\
   **It doesn’t happen often, but I have had one or two traders take mentorship, ***become profitable** *(when they were struggling before), and then complain that they learnt only 5% of new information. Seriously, people? ***This is trading, folks, NOT a term paper. 95% correct is as good as a FAIL. You cannot afford to be anything less than 100% sure in your analysis*****.\
   **.**\
   **That’s different from saying you have to be 100% accurate, by the way. I’d be lying and you’d be a fool to believe me if I told you that was possible. In fact, **[my own track record](http://straighttalktrading.wordpress.com/trading-track-record/)** proves I can’t do it. I put that record up for two reasons:\
   .\
   \(a) To be accountable for all **[the trade calls I make ahead of time on DailyFX](http://www.dailyfx.com/guest-authors/bio/Kaye_Lee)**, a third party website. It’s a waste of everyone’s time if I pretty it up.\
   \(b) To prove that over time, through the seasons of probability, the Straight Talk Trading methodology works.\
   .

2. **Learn the universal principles of good trading. **There aren’t that many of them, and you’ve probably heard of them before: trend, cycles, multiple timeframe analysis, support and resistance, confluence, triggers, position sizing, stop losses, trade management. Why go over it again if you already know it? Simple - *you probably learnt it wrong.*Remember what I said about needing to know trading 100%? Well, somewhere in there is probably what you’re missing. But you’re probably still sceptical, so **let me prove this to you.\
   **.**\
   **Let’s take the concept of “trend”. Simple enough, right? As long as price is headed in one direction generally, it’s a trend. Wait a minute. If I give 10 traders the exact same chart, are they going to agree on the direction of the move? Maybe, if the move is a screaming directional one. However, one guy is going to start looking at trend lines. Another might be assessing swing highs and swing lows. Yet others could be using moving average crossovers. The guy in the corner might be looking at the tiniest little swing backwards in an uptrend and decide that it’s down. The “intuitive” trader might go on what the gut says or the general impression of the chart.\
   .\
   So who’s right?\
   .\
   *Every single one of those people could be right, depending on how they trade.* You see, **how useful your definition of trend is depends on the rest of your strategy**. If you’re looking to catch only small moves, then the guy with the magnifying glass might be the right one. If you are looking for bigger moves, maybe the trend line trader has it right for you. My point is, **before we had this discussion, you probably hadn’t given much thought to the fact that even your definition of trend may not be clear (and therefore not repeatable, and therefore not useful), and even if it was clear, the reason you have been failing is probably because the other parts of your strategy don’t fit together properly!\
   **.**\
   **…So, still think this is old hat? I have to go over this with you at least briefly so that we’re on the same page. When I say “horse”, I can’t have you looking for “elephant”. There is no point in going further until you have all the *exact *pieces of jigsaw puzzle of trading.\
   .

3. **Verify, verify, verify.** One thing you do not get with my personal mentoring is a big, fat manual full of perfect examples, because I believe the only use for something like that is for putting your coffee mug on. Instead, we analyse markets live as they progress. I want you to see how they work out day to day, hands-on, live. A lot of things look good in theory, and experience suggests that in spite of thinking they know it, clients may not actually be able to apply the techniques.\
   .\
   You have to see things as a trader would see them, and see how each moment was analysed and played. If you read the main page of this website, you will know that I only succeeded as a trader because my own mentor was willing to tell me what he saw every single moment under rigorous backtesting simulations. **I aim to give you that same experience, only better – in live markets.** **Once we have entered the market, I don’t know what is going to happen next any better than you you do, but I have a plan for everything that *could *happen.**\
   .

4. **Sit in the driver’s seat and take trades in front of me.** I believe this is the ultimate skill-building exercise. I usually try to get the necessary theoretical learning out of the way as quickly as possible, so that we can spend more time having you analyse and trade in front of me. Given the limitations of time, they won’t be longer term trades, but at least I’ll be able to coach you live through a trade from beginning to end. ***That will hard-wire the correct responses into your emotional system so that you can take the right actions the next time, in the heat of battle. ***You will always have these powerful experiences to return to if you face confusion whilst navigating the markets in the future.\
   .

***MENTORSHIP STRUCTURE***

The mentorship is spread out over 3 months, with one 90-minute session per week. That will give you time to digest, review and apply what you have learnt. It is conducted online, and as of now it is one-on-one. If you are interested in the course, please see the instructions for applying below.

***HOW TO APPLY: ***

If you wish to explore mentoring possibilities, use the **contact form at the bottom of this page** to apply for a mutual interview session. I personally promise you that there will be no pressure to join. (If there is – hang up. That’s a red flag right there.) The purpose of the interview is to see if the one-on-one Mentorship Programme we offer is a good fit for you - *your right to decide if it works for you is fully respected, just as we ask you to respect our right to politely decline to provide training*.******

With warmest regards,

Kaye Lee
